# Marilyn's Plant Store ðŸª´

An eCommerce demo store created as the [React Formula](https://react-formula.com/) capstone project.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind
- React Router
- clsx
- Framer Motion

## Further Optimizations

This app was built as part of a course curriculum, but if I was going to optimize it more I'd like to

- Introduce caching for cart & shop item API requests
- Cart item quantity editing
- Better UX for pot color selection (hover isn't for decision making)
- Add a true home page
- Add a checkout page with test payment integration
- Add controls for sort order on plant list page
